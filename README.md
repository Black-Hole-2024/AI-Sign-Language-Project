# ENGBABA (እንግባባ) AI-Powerd-Sign-Language-Translator Mobile Application Project

Welcome to ENGBABA Github repository! The ENGBABA (እንግባባ) AI-Powered Sign Language Translator Mobile Application is a game-changer, aims to break down communication barriers between people who use sign language and those who do not, by offering real-time translation of sign language motions into spoken language and sign language motions into Text language and vice versa.

## A Collaborative Effort:

This project is a testament to the power of collaboration, brought to life by the Black Hole Team at the A2SV - AI For Africa Hackathon 2024. We're inviting you to join us on this journey by exploring the ENGBABA Github repository.

## Structure
The ENGBABA repository is structured to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to:

backend/: This directory houses the backend code of the ENGBABA (እንግባባ) platform, encompassing the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework and TensorFlow.
frontend/: Here, you'll find the frontend code for the ENGBABA (እንግባባ) platform, crafted using JavaScript, React Native, and Redux or Dart with Flutter Fream Work. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
models/: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models utilized by ENGBABA (እንግባባ) to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries, and they play a pivotal role in addressing communication barriers between people who use sign language and those who do not.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the ENGBABA (እንግባባ) platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models Power of ENGBABA (እንግባባ) AI-Powerd-Sign-Language-Translator Mobile Application

ENGBABA (እንግባባ) leverages the integration of multiple AI models to different services (Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models, BERT, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), etc...), to create an AI-Powered Sign Language Translator Mobile Application conversation. Key features include:

Simplified and user-friendly interface
Real-time Internet search integration for updated information
Versatile use cases including text generation, image creation, and more.

## Join us in creating a more inclusive and connected world!

Let's empower deaf individuals and build a future where communication knows no bounds.
